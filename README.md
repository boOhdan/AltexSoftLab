# AltexSoftLab

**Hello everyone!**

***In this repository, you can see my result after finishing AltexSoft course for Net. students. Therefore, the course has four modules, every of which includes lectures and homework. Since each module's task complements a previous one, there is no clear division into separate HW as such.  So, I will try shortly determine the formal characteristics of each module. Let's start.***
